## About Student-Companion
* Student companion is the guide every student is looking for when they move to a new city. It helps them overcome their day-to-day obstacles and help them to cope up with the life of the new city.
* Every year lakhs of students move around the country pursuing higher studies and feel lost away from their home. They are unaware of their surroundings and also about the way things function in the city. They look for people to guide them but due to lack of interactions are unable to explore the city.
